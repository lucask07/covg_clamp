-----------------------------

Instructions for turnkey assembly of 4 already fabricated PCBs.  
I will provide de-panelized boards (5) so that 4 can be assembled. 
Boards are standard thickness 1.6 mm and have HASL silk-screen. 
RoHS is not required but is OK if less expensive. 

Lead-time: targeting an assembly time of <14 days, less expense is a higher priority than speed. 

152 SMT parts 
3 Thru-hole parts 

The part position file is provided with .pos extension; top and bottom are in the same file.
Fab files are provided as PDF with 1:1 scaling. top_fabfile.pdf, bottom_fabfile.pdf
A .zip file of gerbers is provided which includes the drill files.
The BOM is provided as 'bath_clamp_v1_bom_assembly.xlsx'. Please use the 'Manf. Number' column as the priority column to determine the part to purchase. Some parts that are low in stock have been provided an 'Alternative Manf. Number'.  
 
Equivalent parts may be used for resistors and capacitors if voltage rating and tolerances are maintained. 
Please check with me if alternative ICs need to be used.
