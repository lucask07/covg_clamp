layout notes for COVG clamp:

need direction silkscreen for pin jacks (maybe might be symmetrical) - symmetric 
G6L-1 relay (fix pin 1 and overlapping text); REF des? - done 
must determine how to resize ref designators 
add r and C compensation (that's DNI)
ferrites for mounting holes 
set origin 
fiducials for stencil 
easily draw power planes 
check if any components are from strange libraries 
setup net classes 
review board size
